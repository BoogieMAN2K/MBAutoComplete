# MBAutoComplete
<strong>Completely customizable Xamarin iOS autocomplete field</strong>

![Example](MarcBruins.github.com/MBAutoComplete/images/example.png)


Note that library is not an out of the box solution that looks perfectly on everything. It has some default behaviour which you can use to setup an autocomplete field really quick if that is what you want. But the nice thing about this library is that it is completely customizable.

<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Add the package to your project.</li>
 	<li>In the interface builder select the textfield that you want to have autocomplete functionality and bind it to the viewcontroller</li>
 	<li>Change the class Â to "MBAutoCompleteTextField"</li>
 	<li>Call the setup method in the <strong>ViewDidAppear</strong></li>
 	<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
